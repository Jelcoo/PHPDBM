# PHPDMB

## Accessing the application

You can access the application by using the following credentials:
```
Host: mysql
Port: 3306
Username: developer
Password: secret123
```
This will connect you to the default host and allows you to access the demo database `demodb`.

## API Endpoint

This is the endpoint that will be used to interact with the PHPDMB API.

The endpoint is located at `/api/databases`. Due to the design of this application, you have to be authenticated via the normal API first in order to use this endpoint.
